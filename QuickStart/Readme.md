Help yourself with the following Exercises to get some insights and practical experience into a Cloud Foundry application even as a non-techie.

The basic idea here is to push a very simple Java application to Cloud Foundry and to test the REST API afterwards with a Rest client such as `Postman`.


- [Exercise 1: Deploy a Java application on Cloud Foundry](Exercise1_CloudFoundry.md)
- [Exercise 2: Test your Rest API using `Postman`](Exercise2_TestYourRESTApi.md)
- [Exercise 3: Analyze your logs using `Kibana`](Exercise3_KibanaLoggingDashboard.md)
- [Exercise 4: Clean Up](Exercise4_CleanUp.md)

### Important: 
As you deploy an application and use a database service instance in Cloud Foundry on AWS infrastructure which generate costs for SAP, we ask you to delete your deployment and service in [Exercise 4](Exercise4_CleanUp.md). Thank you.
