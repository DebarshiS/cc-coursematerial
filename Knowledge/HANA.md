HANA backing services
- [hana, managed-hana and others HANA services in SCP CF](https://jam4.sapjam.com/blogs/show/ejRXywiSGmVBknQcQD1gPj)

Available plans
- **hdi-shared**: this plan creates an HDI container to which you can deploy database artifacts using the HANA Deployment Infrastructure.
More information on HDI can be found here: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/ngdb/HANA+DI
You may want to use the HDI deployer application to deploy database artifacts to an HDI container running inside CloudFoundry or XSA On-Premise: https://github.wdf.sap.corp/xs2/hdideploy.js
 
- **schema**: this plan is basically a plain schema, which you need to manage on your own. You might want to use this plan if your application uses an OR Mapper concept and a framework creates the necessary database resources on the fly by itself.
 
- **sbss** & **securestore**: these two are special plans to use the HANA SBSS functionality to create secure schema names and the securestore within HANA.
 
The schemas canâ€™t be named. The user and schema names are generated by the HANA Broker at random. HDI provides a concept to access database artifacts in another container.
