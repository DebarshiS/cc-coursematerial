Dear colleagues,
 
**Before the training you need to setup your development environment** as described in [this document](https://github.com/ccjavadev/cc-coursematerial/blob/master/CoursePrerequisites/README.md). In addition we strongly suggest to do the two exercises described there to be optimally prepared for the course, unless you are an experienced Java developer.
In case you run into troubles, please contact us!
